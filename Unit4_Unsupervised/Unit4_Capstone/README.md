\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Unit4-Unsupervised-Learning\
Can a song's lyrics predict it's genre?\
\
_This project will try to predict the genre of a song and the genre when the song is split by sentences. Unsupervised and Supervised learning will be used. We will see if the model can predict clusters of the same genre as well as the sentiment of the songs. The first notebook(4.1) contains the data scraping, sentence and song dataframes. The second notebook(4.2) contains the sentiment analysis._\

_The data was prepared by scrapping\'a0www.lyricsfreak.com\'a0using beautiful soup._}
