Lending Club loan predictions
_Supervised learning is used to predict whether a loan is good or bad.  Good means a loan will be paid back without being late.  Bad loans are loans in default, late after 30 days.  Algorithms Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost are used to predict the good loans.  Unsupervised learning clusters the loans are either good or bad and then takes a look at the top 5 features to see if they are classified as good loans. Kmeans and MeanShift will be the two algorithms explored._

_The data was sourced from their website.  Both approved and rejected loan data was used for this project._
