    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The heapsort algorithm can be divided into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, a heap is built out of the data. The heap is often placed in an array with the layout of a complete binary tree. The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into the array indices; each array index represents a node; the index of the node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions. For a zero-based array, the root node is stored at index 0; if i is the index of the current node, then\n",
    "\n",
    "    iParent(i)     = floor((i-1) / 2) where floor functions map a real number to the smallest leading integer.\n",
    "    iLeftChild(i)  = 2*i + 1\n",
    "    iRightChild(i) = 2*i + 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the second step, a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and inserting it into the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the result is a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapsort can be performed in place. The array can be split into two parts, the sorted array and the heap. The storage of heaps as arrays is diagrammed here. The heap's invariant is preserved after each extraction, so the only cost is that of extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a simple way to implement the algorithm in pseudocode. Arrays are zero-based\n",
    "and swap is used to exchange two elements of the array. Movement 'down' means from the root \n",
    "towards the leaves, or from lower indices to higher. Note that during the sort, the largest \n",
    "element is at the root of the heap at a[0], while at the end of the sort, the largest element is in a[end].\n",
    "\n",
    "procedure heapsort(a, count) is\n",
    "    input: an unordered array a of length count\n",
    " \n",
    "    (Build the heap in array a so that largest value is at the root)\n",
    "    heapify(a, count)\n",
    "\n",
    "    (The following loop maintains the invariants that a[0:end] is a heap and every element\n",
    "     beyond end is greater than everything before it (so a[end:count] is in sorted order))\n",
    "    end ← count - 1\n",
    "    while end > 0 do\n",
    "        (a[0] is the root and largest value. The swap moves it in front of the sorted elements.)\n",
    "        swap(a[end], a[0])\n",
    "        (the heap size is reduced by one)\n",
    "        end ← end - 1\n",
    "        (the swap ruined the heap property, so restore it)\n",
    "        siftDown(a, 0, end)\n",
    "        \n",
    "The sorting routine uses two subroutines, heapify and siftDown. The former is the common in-place\n",
    "heap construction routine, while the latter is a common subroutine for implementing heapify."
